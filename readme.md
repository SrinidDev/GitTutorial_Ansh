This is first created to register the master branch initially

## so lets say we dnt want to publically expose api key so that time to make git not to track what we can do is in the same directory level just create .gitignore and add the file names inside it with extension so it will not be tracked by git

## git ususally dont track empty folders so it will not show 'U' when we simply create a folder ok so when we add any file below the folder it will start tracking it

## So what if i want to track an empty folder... becoz i want to maintain the structure so that time create an folder and inside that folder  creaet an .gitkeep file it is an hidden file it will show so the now the empty folder can also be tracked
